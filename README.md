# CVE Management System

## Overview
This Flask application provides a simple API for managing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data. It allows users to retrieve, add, and delete CVE records stored in a SQLite database.

## Setup Instructions

### Dependencies

```
Python 3.12.1
Flask==2.0.2
Flask-SQLAlchemy==3.0.1
```

1. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Loading Data into the Database
1. Navigate to the project directory containing the `import_data.py` script.

2. Run the `import_data.py` script to load data from the CSV file into the SQLite database:

```
python import_data.py
```

### Running the Application
1. Make sure you are in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated.
```
python -m venv venv
```
2. Run the Flask application:

```
python app.py
```

3. The application will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /cve/<cve_id>**: Retrieve details of a specific CVE.
- **GET /cve/all**: Retrieve all CVE data.
- **POST /cve/addCVE**: Add a new CVE record.
- **DELETE /cve/<cve_id>**: Delete a CVE record.

## Testing
- Use tools like Postman or cURL to send HTTP requests to the Flask application's API endpoints and verify their functionality.
```
# GET request to retrieve details of a specific CVE
curl http://localhost:5000/cve/CVE-2014-9999

# GET request to retrieve all CVE data
curl http://localhost:5000/cve/all

# POST request to add a new CVE record
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"cve_id": "CVE-2014-54321", "severity": "High", "cvss": 8.9, "affected_packages": "Package A", "description": "Description of CVE-2024-5678", "cwe_id": "CWE-123"}' http://localhost:5000/cve/addCVE

# DELETE request to delete a CVE record
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/cve/CVE-2014-123456

```

## Error Handling
- If an error occurs during API request processing, the server will respond with an appropriate HTTP status code and an error message in JSON format.
- Try-except blocks are used for exception handling.
